This is where we clean and prepare the data

Creating the age-band subsets from the smaller ANES data set that contains only 
variables of interest.

```{r}

anes_genY <- subset(anes_small, anes$dem_age_r_x > 17 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 33) 
#creates Millennial subset 
anes_genX <- subset(anes_small, anes$dem_age_r_x > 32 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 48) 
#creates Generation X subset 
anes_boomer <- subset(anes_small, anes$dem_age_r_x > 47 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 67) 
#creates Baby Boomer subset 
anes_silent <- subset(anes_small, anes$dem_age_r_x > 66 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 88) 
#creates Silent Generation subset

#set up an objects to run with the logit models that allow for results to be 
#statistically representative of the population through weighting 

ANESdesign_genY <- svydesign(~psu ,  strata = ~strata , data = anes_genY , weights = ~weights, variables = NULL, nest = TRUE)

ANESdesign_genX <- svydesign(~psu ,  strata = ~strata , data = anes_genX , weights = ~weights, variables = NULL, nest = TRUE)

ANESdesign_boomer <- svydesign(~psu ,  strata = ~strata , data = anes_boomer, weights = ~weights, variables = NULL, nest = TRUE)

ANESdesign_silent <- svydesign(~psu ,  strata = ~strata , data = anes_silent, weights = ~weights, variables = NULL, nest = TRUE)
```

Running logistic regression model with confidence intervals

```{r}

#Running a logit, generation by generation. Then looking at a summary of the results, follows by looking at and creating an object for the coeffs of the results. Then converting those results to probabilities by exp(ing) them 

#Millennials
M_genY <- svyglm(vote_2012 ~ education + unemployed + female + vote_2008 + race, design = ANESdesign_genY, family = "quasibinomial") 
summary(M_genY)
genY_coef <- coef(M_genY)
exp(genY_coef)

#Baby Boomers
M_boomer <- svyglm(vote_2012 ~ education + unemployed + female + vote_2008 + race, design = ANESdesign_boomer, family = "quasibinomial") 
summary(M_boomer)
boomer_coef <- coef(M_boomer)
exp(boomer_coef)

#Gen X
M_genX <- svyglm(vote_2012 ~ education + unemployed + female + vote_2008 + race, design = ANESdesign_genX, family = "quasibinomial") 
summary(M_genX)
genX_coef <- coef(M_genX)
exp(genX_coef)


# Looking at confidence intervals of parameter point estimates 

confint(M_genY)
confint(M_boomer)
confint(M_genX)

#Giving odds ratios with confidence intervals in a table 

exp(cbind(OR = coef(M_genY), confint(M_genY)))
```

Now playing with and plotting predicted probabilities based on the model

```{r}

#manually collecting probabilities

#1-probability for high-school educated black employed woman who didn't vote in 2008
prob_genY_ed2 <- (exp(-0.3448 + 0.5263 + 0.1249 + 0.6389))/(1+exp(-0.3448 + 0.5263 + 0.1249 + 0.6389)) 

#2-probability for high-school educated black employed woman who didn't vote in 2008








#creating a data frame of fitted values for a hypothetical black woman

blackfem_genY <- with(anes_genY, data.frame(female = 1, race = 2, vote_2008 = 0, unemployed = 0, education = factor(1:5))) 

#this is an alternative we've played around with that includes the weighting columns
#used by the survey package as well
blackfem_genY <- with(anes_genY, data.frame(caseID = factor(1:5), weights = .506, psu = 1, strata = 6, female = 1, race = 2, vote_2008 = 0, unemployed = 0, education = factor(1:5))) 

#predict probability point estimates for each fitted value.

blackfem_genY$predicted_prob <- prediction(M_genY, data = blackfem_genY, type = "response")

blackfem_genY$predicted_prob <- predict(M_genY, newdata = blackfem_genY, type = "response", se = TRUE)
#another alternative
blackfem_genY$predicted_prob <- predict(M_genY, newdata = blackfem_genY, type = "response", 
                                        design = ANESdesign_genY)

#Now to plot this with confidence intervals.
#First, add the confidence intervals

blackfem_genY <- cbind(blackfem_genY, predict(M_genY, newdata = blackfem_genY, type="link", se=TRUE))
blackfem_genY <- within(blackfem_genY, {
  prob <- plogis(fit)
  LL <- plogis(fit - (1.96 * se.fit))
  UL <- plogis(fit + (1.96 * se.fit))
})

# want to have lines for the two generation we are comparing 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(blackfem_genY, aes(x = education, y = prob, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = LL, ymax = UL), alpha = .2) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = education), size=1)

#this plot doesn't look great at the moment, but it does work. 
```

Assessing the model fit. I draw on the UCLA page here for this: 
http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm 

In short: the results below are good, but I don't really know how to explain them.

```{r}

with(M_genY, null.deviance - deviance) #gives chi-square value
with(M_genY, df.null - df.residual) #gives degrees of freed
with(M_genY, pchisq(null.deviance - deviance, df.null - df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)) 
#last command gives p-value, which is very small and tells us "our model as a whole fits #significantly better than an empty model," according to the UCLA page that Christopher
#used for some of the demonstration in class. But I have no idea what that actually means.

Notes from class Nov. 18

Should have correlation matrix like on slide 22 of the Nov. 18 class

Run the simulated stuff he did for presentation purposes. Need a regression table
and other stuff, but for highlighting the main effects that's simply not
a good idea. Simluation helps show the results and how confident we are
about those results. Gives an expectation of what we would see in the "real world"
based on the assumptions of our model.
